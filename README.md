On July 20th, 2018 at HOPE ( "Hackers on Planet Earth" / Twitter: @hopeconf 
Web: http://hope.net ) a presentation was given by Da Beave & Faux Real bout 
"Bots" & "Fake News".  This repo contains the source code used to generate the
data used for that talk. 

Please check back later.  We will be updating the README.md with links to the 
presentations video & presentation material. 

If you have any questions about the presentation or the source code,  please open an
issue. (link to issues here!)
